# Challenge 1: App with Emoji-Only UI

<img src="../assets/emojis.png" width="700" alt="Emojis">

## Themes
- Build with Chainguard Containers
- Get weird

## The Challenge
Build a fully functional application where the entire user interface uses ONLY emojis. No text allowed in any interactive elements - buttons, navigation, labels, everything must be emojis. Extra points if, like, everything is emojis.

## Requirements
- All UI elements must be emojis only (no text in the interface)
- Ideally the app will actually do something
- Must be containerized using Chainguard Containers. You can set it up with a Dockerfile and we'll build and run locally. If it's a web app, it should able to be run on some port and be seen locally. If it's a CLI app, we'll run the default entrypoint and go from there. Feel free to give us directions in the README (replace this file).

## Dumb Ideas

Stuck? Here are some derivative ideas!

- Calculator (🔢 ➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗)
- Todo app (✅ ❌ 📝 🗑️)
- Weather app (☀️ 🌧️ ❄️ 🌡️)
- Music player (▶️ ⏸️ ⏭️ 🔀 🔁)
- Mini game (🎮)
- Demonic energy detector (😈)
- Beanie baby collection database / sorter (🐢🧸, topical!)
